<p>Queen Victoria resumed the conversation with the bottle she’d lifted from the diner. The sherry might taste of crap but it at least wasn’t a good judge of character. Bad deeds need an easy audience.</p>
<p>The Glock had been taken from the arm of a dead man, the pistol had been dropped from a plane in the middle of nowhere, and even the bottle was covered in the fingerprints of criminals. No one needed a bottle to tell them they were going down.</p>
<p>"Are you the one who just came to tell me about how you were going to steal a gun?"</p>
<p>The voice was familiar, but it didn’t sound familiar at the same time. She nodded. "I’m the one who just told you about the other things I have planned. I’m going to kill your family and then go back to my hotel."</p>
<p>"You aren't going to kill my family?"</p>
<p>"No." She held the bottle to her lips</p>
