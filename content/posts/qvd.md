Queen Victoria resumed the conversation with the bottle she'd lifted from the diner. The sherry might taste of crap but it at least wasn't a good judge of character. Bad deeds need an easy audience.  

The Glock lay on the desk like a Christmas present waiting to be wrapped. Was it enough or should she pack the lead sceptre?  

Victoria slipped two spare clips for the Glock into her corset. Diplomacy was for mugs.  

No-one told Queens to be silent.  

The sherry agreed.
