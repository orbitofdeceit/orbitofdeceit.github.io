I'll send you a screenshot when my code’s not fast  
I'll send you a screenshot when my type won’t cast  
I'll send you a screenshot when the log’s too long  
I'll send you a screenshot when it all goes wrong.  

*Chorus:* I took a screenshot  
Have you heard the news?  
I took a screenshot    
Now I need your views  
I took a screenshot  
I’ve got those screenshot blues.  

I'll send you a screenshot, I don't read the docs  
I'll send you a screenshot of that big black box  
I'll send you screenshot when my job won't run  
I'll send you screenshot and my work is done  

*Chorus*  

I'll send you a screenshot when I can't commit  
I'll send you a screenshot 'cause I don’t know shit.  
I'll send you a screenshot when my code don't parse  
I'll send you a screenshot then I pick my arse.

*Chorus*
